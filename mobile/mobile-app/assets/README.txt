Temporary placeholder assets were added automatically because referenced image files were missing:
- singup.png (probably meant signup.png?)
- facebooksignup.png
- googlesinn.png (possibly typo for googleSignIn?)
- finger.png
- flash (2).png

Replace these placeholder PNGs with real images. Filenames kept as referenced in code to avoid runtime errors.
